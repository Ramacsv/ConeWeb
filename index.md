The story of Suitecase’s  plan to bring the ice cream.

As I have told you in my early stories, Suitecase lives in the sky on may islands. He also lives on earth. One of the island is Lake Island where there are ten lakes. In one of the lakes ice cream floats. 

Now from earth Suitecase went to get ice cream from the lake island.

He has a parachute . He created a big web called it Coneweb in the shape of a cone. He made it out of steel and gold. He covered the outside with paste made out of flower. He was trying to stick all the things together so it woud’nt  break and ice cream woud’nt  fall off.  It also for decoration. 

He filled it with ice cream and tied it up to the parachute. He opened the parachute  and started gliding from point A to reach point B on earth.  It made a sound like oooooop!. He landed at point B. The Coneweb also landed with a splash. It cracked open in a door shape.
He took the ice cream out, Put it in cones and started selling it.
It has a unique taste that has nothing ever any one tasted before.
It was all sold out. 
People were vey happy and wanted more. Suitecase
 Promised them that he would get more.

Everyone was happy.
